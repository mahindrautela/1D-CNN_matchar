####  Please cite the paper if you are using the code, datasets or paper for your research paper.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### The dataset can also be asked from the authors of the paper by directly emailing them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Details:

#### - This code can be run on a jupyter notebook either on a google colab platform (Recommended) or a personal computer with jupyter. 

#### - To run the code on a personal jupyter platform, you need to add some lines of code to convert tensorflow 1.x to 2.x if current system is using tensorflow 2.x

#### - Each line of code is provided with the heading and neccessary descriptions.

#### - To access the code on google colab, you need to put the dataset in the google drive. 

#### - "mount drive" and the address of the google drive folder will help to import the dataset in the code.

#### - For more information, you can write to me at my email id given in the paper.
