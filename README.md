##This code is a part of the work presented in the paper:

**Ultrasonic Guided Waves Based Identification of Elastic Properties Using 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks.**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##The dataset is also available at:
*https://sites.google.com/site/mahindrautela/datasets_and_codes?authuser=0*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###This code can be run on a jupyter notebook either on a google colab platform (Recommended)
or a personal computer with jupyter. 

###To run the code on a personal jupyter platform, you need to add some lines of code to convert tensorflow 1.x to
2.x if current system is using tensorflow 2.x

###Each line of code is provided with the heading.

###To access the code on google colab, you need to put the dataset in the google drive and 
"mount drive" and the address of the folder will help to import the dataset.
