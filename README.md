This code is a part of the work presented in the paper:

Ultrasonic Guided Waves Based Identification of Elastic Properties Using 
1D-Convolutional Neural Networks.

This code can be run on a jupyter notebook either on a google colab platform
or a personal computer with jupyter. To run the code on a personal jupyter
platform, you need to add some lines of code to convert tensorflow 1.x to
2.x if current system is using tensorflow 2.x
